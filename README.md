This project was started after we made a joke about how would it be nice to simply hide the whole D2R chat lobby, 
since Blizzard is not giving any care at making it usable or a pleasant feature.

So, by using Open Source library, and once again, no cheat or no hack (we are not reading the game memory, we are not injecting anything in, 
we are simply relying on a regular tcp connections in-game detection, and when we are out of game, we are considered to be in the lobby.

While in the lobby, we apply different imagerie technique and advanced image and shape recongnition by using open source libraries that help us to do that.

We then simply create a DirectX Overlay with something more appropriate.

Let me know when the Chat Lobby ever become usable, so that I can update this application accordingly :)
